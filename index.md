# Good Morning, Good Evening or Hello!

Welcome to my Github showroom of my work For **Assignment One**!

## The purpose of this page

I have created this page to showcase my work for **Assignment one** which will include:
1. The meme itself
2. My reasons / inpirations as to why I created this specific meme
3. The code that I produced that resulted in the meme's creation

## The meme:

This meme was created using `R`, but also included using the [{Magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package

*A very robust and powerfull package that most `R` users should utalise!!*
